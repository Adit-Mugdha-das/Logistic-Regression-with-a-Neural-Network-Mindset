# Logistic Regression with a Neural Network Mindset 

This repository contains my programming assignment submission from **Week 2 of Course 1: Neural Networks and Deep Learning** in the **Deep Learning Specialization** by Andrew Ng on Coursera.

##  Description

In this assignment, I implemented a **Logistic Regression** model using **NumPy**, applying a neural network mindset to build and optimize a binary image classifier — distinguishing whether an image contains a cat or not.

### Key Concepts Covered:
- Vectorization for efficient computation
- Sigmoid activation function
- Cost function and gradient computation
- Optimization using gradient descent
- Image preprocessing using NumPy

##  Dataset

The dataset contains 64x64 RGB images of cats and non-cats. Images are flattened into vectors and normalized before being passed to the logistic regression model.

##  Files

- `logistic_regression_with_a_neural_network_mindset.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook for implementation
- `lr_utils.py`: Utility file for loading and handling the dataset
- `images/`: Sample images used in prediction and visualization

> ⚠️ Only my own code and implementation are included. No proprietary course material or solutions are shared that would violate Coursera's Honor Code.
